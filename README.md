**NIT6150 - AdvancedProject: No Yelling Driving School App**
-

**Overview**
-
This project was developed as part of my university coursework. Our group collaborated to identify and address a real-world issue faced by No Yelling Driving School. 
To better understand the problem, we conducted marketing analysis by reviewing their Google reviews, where we found many students mentioning that their messages were ignored or 
they did not receive course cancellation notifications.

To help solve this problem, we designed and developed a prototype mobile application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app demonstrates how an improved notification system
could be integrated and provides a visual representation of the proposed solution.

**Features**
-
* Modern UI: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to simulate a mobile app interface
* Notification System: Designed to showcase how real-time notifications could be delivered to users
* User Experience Focused: Emphasis on usability and accessibility for both students and instructors

**Built With**
-
* JavaScript
* HTML
* CSS

**Live Demo Link**
-
Note: This prototype is designed specifically for mobile devices. For the best experience, open the demo link in your 
browser's developer tools and select a device such as iPhone 12 Pro or iPhone 14 Pro Max to preview the mobile layout.

**Project Motivation**
-
No Yelling Driving School needed a more reliable way to deliver notifications to its students. Our project provides a prototype solution,
demonstrating how a dedicated mobile app could address this gap and improve the overall experience.
